Introduction
============

*This is part A) in the project plan [sv: projektredogörelse]. *


*The background/introduction should summarise the scope of the problem,
what is known about the problem, what is not known, what specific
knowledge gap the study is supposed to fill and why this is
important. It should end be stating the aim of the study. The
background should be 4-5 paragraphs long and each paragraph should be
between 3-5 sentences. Strive to make the paragraphs about the same
length.*

*bibliography.bib includes an example reference. Add additional
references in that file as bibtex entries and then cite in text using:
"[@exampleKey9999]". One can convert DOIs' to bibtex entries using 
https://www.doi2bib.org/. If you use Zotero you can simply export 
entries to bibtex `Ctrl-Shift-C`, however you need to first setup

Trauma is a significant global public health concern, responsible for causing death and disability in over four million people each year. Among those affected, younger populations are more impacted, making trauma management a worldwide health care concern[@noauthor_injuries_nodate]. The initial management of trauma patients in the hospital setting is time-sensitive and prone to errors, which can adversely affect patient outcomes[@mackersie_pitfalls_2010]. Trauma patients presenting with shock have a notably higher mortality compared to those who are not in shock, underscoring the need for improved care strategies for these patients[@vang_shock_2022].
Shock is generally defined as circulatory failure resulting in insufficient perfusion and oxygenation of tissues and organs[@leech_shock_2023]. There are four primary causes of shock: hypovolemic, obstructive, cardiogenic and distributive. These etiologies can occur alone or in combination. In the context of trauma, hypovolemic shock, usually caused by massive hemorrhage, is the most common type of shock[@teixeira_preventable_2007].

To classify shock in trauma 
The Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) classification for hypovolemic shock based on the parameters of "blood loss", "heart rate", "blood pressure", "respiratory rate", "mental status" and "urine output". ATLS divides hypovolemic shock into four distinct classes, ranging from mild to severe. However, this classification is specific to hypovolemic shock and does not account for the other types of shock like obstructive.

To address other types of diseases, such as other types of trauma shock, triage systems like Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System (RETTS) and National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) are used in emergency care. While these systems are not shock-specific, they are useful for assessing patients in various shock states by using vital signs such as heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate (RR) and mental status.

RETTS is designed for triage in emergency departments and uses color-coded categories (red, orange, yellow, green, and blue) to rank patients by urgency. It incorporates parameters similar to those used in ATLS, but also include airway, saturation and temperature. This makes it applicable to patients in various forms of shock, including hypovolemic, cardiogenic and distributive shock(källa?).

NEWS2, on the other hand, is a scoring system developed to track the clinical deterioration of patients. Like ATLS and RETTS, it evaluates HR, BP, RR, and mental status, but also includes oxygen saturation and temperature. NEWS2 is especially valuable for monitoring patients over time and identifying those at risk of deteriorating, regardless of the underlying cause of shock(källa?).

Despite their differences, all three systems ATLS, RETTS and NEWS2 share similarities in their use of vital sign markers such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and mental status. This overlap suggests using these four parameters as a base for general classification for all types of shock is justifiable(är det verkligen så, får man anta det?). 

To improve trauma care quality, healthcare systems identify Opportunities for Improvement (OFI) through structured reviews of patient cases. Multidisciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews play a central role in this process, where clinicians from different specialities together analyse trauma cases to evaluate both the structure and clinical processes involved in trauma care following the Donabedian’s quality of care framework[@albaaj_patient_2023]. For shock patients, timely interventions such as fluid resuscitation/blood transfusion, intervention, OR and radiology are critical, and delays or missteps can result in adverse outcomes (källa). By systematically addressing OFIs, healthcare providers can improve the effectiveness of trauma care, directly impacting mortality and morbidity(källa).
      
This study aims to describe the types of opportunities for improvement for adult trauma patients arriving in shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.


Methods
=======

*Refer to the appropriate reporting guideline for details. If you are
developing, updating or validating a clinical prediction model then
use
[TRIPOD](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/tripod-statement/). If
you are conducting an observational study, for example a cohort or
case control study in which you assess associations between some
exposure and an outcome then use
[STROBE](https://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/strobe/).*

Study design
We conducted a registry based retrospective cohort study, using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. We then linked the two databases to assess what types of OFI occurred in patients arriving in shock and use adjusted logistic regression to assess the association between the degree of shock and odds of opportunities for improvement. 

Setting
The trauma registry includes about 14000 patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna between 2012 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2023. Karolinska University Hospital in Solna acts as a level one trauma center according to critera set by American College of Surgeons(), and treats all major trauma in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm.  

Participatns
Every trauma patient at Karolinska University Hospital is included in a morbidity and mortality review process, which involves both individual case evaluations by specialized nurses and audit filters. Patients identified with a high potential for OFIs are discussed at multidisciplinary conferences. The identified OFIs are then categorized into broader areas. The multidisciplinary conferences are held every six to eight weeks, during which an average of ten patient cases are reviewed by experienced specialists from all trauma-related fields. The presence or absence of OFIs is determined by consensus among all participants and is documented in the trauma care quality database.

To qualify into the trauma registry, requires admission by trauma team activation or any admission with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of more than nine. We included all patients in ... between ... and ... We excluded patients younger than 18 and/or were dead on arrival. 

Variable and measurements
To classify the patients "heart rate", "blood pressure", "respiratory rate" and "mental status" will be used as independent variables for classification of shock regardless of their cause.  Based on these four measurements, the patients will be classified into four groups roughly based on the same value as in the ATLS trauma shock classifications. The outcome will be OFI recorded in the trauma care quality database and are binary when used to calculate the association with degree of shock. The subgroups of OFI will be explored and reported in a list, and therefore non-binary.
