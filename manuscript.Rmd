Trauma is a major global public health concern. It causes over four milion death and affects hundreds of millions each year, among those younger populations are the most affected [@noauthor_injuries_nodate]. The initial management of trauma patients once they reach hospital is very time sensitive and error prone [@mackersie_pitfalls_2010] [@teixeira_preventable_2007][@ivatury_patient_2008], and shock is the most common potentially preventable death within the first 24h of injury[@berry_shock_2015]. It is also the second major cause of early mortality in trauma patients [@kauvar_impact_2006], and patients in shock have a higher mortality rate than those not[@vang_shock_2022].

The definition for shock is circulatory failure leading to insuficient perfusion and oxygenation of tissue and organ[@leech_shock_2023]. There are four types of causes, which are hypovolemic, obstructive, cardiogenic and distributive. These causes can occur alone or in combination. The most usual one during trauma are hypovolemic in form of a large bleeding[@teixeira_preventable_2007].

To differentiate the severity of trauma shock, we can divide shock into different degrees. One of such classification is the ATLS classification for major haemorrhage. The classification is divided into four classes, based on the patients: estimated bloodloss, heart frequency (HF), bloodpressure (BP), pulse pressure, respiratory rate (RR), mental status and urine output. However, this only meant to be used for hypovolemic shocks and not the other types. There is other classification for predicting massive transfusion (TASH, ABC), triaging (RETTS) or tracking the clinical deterioration of patients (NEWS2). The common denominator for these classifications is they are all roughly based on vital parameters, however none of them is specifically designed to classify trauma shock degree regardless of the type/cause of shock. ATLS in this regard, even though having its own shortcomings[@guly_vital_2011], still is one of the most used classifications for this topic(Källa).

One way to improve trauma care quality is trough identifying Opportunities for Improvement (OFI). This method has an advantage compared to traditional mortality reviews in that it also includes non-fatals. There are different processes to finding OFIs, but one of the primary ways is structured multidisciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews of patient cases [@world_health_organization_guidelines_2009]. In order for the review content to be as comprehensive as possible for trauma care, the Donabedian quality of care framework can be used[@donabedian_quality_1988]. It is based on the three factors of structure, process and outcome. By following this framework, healthcare providers will be able to systematically find and address OFIs[källa?]. This will in turn improve the effectiveness of trauma care, directly impacting mortality and morbidity[källa?/8].

This study aims to describe the types of opportunities for improvement for adult trauma patients arriving in shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.


Methods 
=======

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->


We conducted a registry based retrospective cohort study, using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. We then linked the two databases to assess what types of OFI occurred in patients arriving in shock and use logistic regression to assess the association between the degree of shock and odds of opportunities for improvement. 


Setting
-------

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including
periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

The trauma registry includes about 14000 patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna between 2014 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review. The Karolinska University Hospital in Solna treats all major trauma in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm.  


Participants
------------

<!-- Cohort study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and
methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of
follow-up. For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of
exposed and unexposed -->

<!-- Case-control study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and + methods of case ascertainment and control
selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and
controls. For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number
of controls per case -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and methods of selection of participants -->

Every trauma patient at Karolinska University Hospital is included in a morbidity and mortality review process, which involves both individual case evaluations by specialized nurses and audit filters. Patients identified with a high potential for OFIs are discussed at multidisciplinary conferences. The identified OFIs are then categorized into broader areas. The multidisciplinary conferences are held every six to eight weeks, during which an average of ten patient cases are reviewed by experienced specialists from all trauma-related fields. The presence or absence of OFIs is determined by consensus among all participants and is documented in the trauma care quality database.

To qualify into the trauma registry, requires admission by trauma team activation or any admission with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of more than nine. We included all patients in ... between 2014 and 2023  We excluded patients younger than 15 and/or were dead on arrival. 


Variables and data sources/measurements
---------------------------------------

<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential
confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if
applicable. For each variable of interest, give sources of data and
details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability
of assessment methods if there is more than one group -->

<!-- Elaborate on the outcome OFI. How is it defined? What are the different types of OFI? -->

To classify the patients the following measurement will be used as independent variables for classification of shock regardless of their cause. Heart rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), respiratory rate(RR) and mental status. Based on these four measurements, the patients will be classified into four groups roughly based on the same value as in the ATLS trauma shock classifications. 

<!-- Elaborate on how you will categorise the degree of shock, what are the different levels?-->
The first group will be patients presenting with a HR below 100 beats per minute(BPM), respiratory rate between 14 to 20. The original ATLS classification only states normal BP, but no number. In our case, we will be using the systolic over 90mmhg as the lower limit up to 65 years old, and 110mmhg as the lower limit for patients older (geriatric patients). The...    

The outcome will be OFI recorded in the trauma care quality database and are binary when used to calculate the association with degree of shock. The subgroups of OFI will be explored and reported in a list, and therefore non-binary.
