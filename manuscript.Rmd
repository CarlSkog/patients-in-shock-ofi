      To be able to assess and improve the quality of trauma care, improvement programmes aim to identify opportunities for improvements(OFI). OFI is multidiciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews, where opportunity for improvements are identified in the structure and clinical process of trauma care[@albaaj_patient_2023]. )

Trauma is a major global public health concern. It causes over four milion death and affects hundreds of millions each year, among those younger populations are the most affected. Not only does it do bodily harm, but also places a burden on national economies, in form of billions of us dollars for health care, lost productivity and law enforcement[@noauthor_injuries_nodate]. 

Shock is a major cause of mortality in trauma patients[@siegel_effect_1995]. The definition for shock is circulatory failure leading to insuficient perfusion and oxygenation of tissue and organ[@leech_shock_2023]. There are four types of causes, which are hypovolemic, obstructive, cardiogenic and distributive. These causes can occur alone or in combination. The most usual one during trauma are hypovolemic in form of a major haemorrhage [@teixeira_preventable_2007]. 

Clinically to be able to differentiate the degree of shock in context of trauma, the ATLS classification for major haemorrhage can be used. The classification is divided into four classes, based on the patients: estimated bloodloss, heart frequency (HF), bloodpressure (BP), pulse pressure, respiratory rate (RR), mental status and urine output. However, this only suits hypovolemic shocks and not the other types. (Källa) There is other classification for triaging or tracking the clinical deterioration of patients, which can be used for other causes of shocks. The common denominator for these classifications is they are all based on vital parameters. 

The initial management of trauma patients once they reach hospital is very time sensitive and error prone [@mackersie_pitfalls_2010][@teixeira_preventable_2007][@ivatury_patient_2008]. 

This is especially worth noting when patients in shock also have a higher mortality rate than those not[@vang_shock_2022]. 

Koppla ihop det mpå nått sätt med att, trauma i sig är tid sensitiv och kaotisk, kombinerat med att chock patienter har högre mortalitet (kanske källa som även säger chock pat är mer kaotisk och tid sensitiv), parallellt har pat med medel+hög iss hög OFI, dessa medel och hög har oftast chock(källa), därför kombinerat kaos natur + kaos från chock + medel skadade oftast med chock har hög ofi -> bör undersöka pat med olika nivåer av chock har ofi. 

To improve trauma care quality, healthcare systems identify Opportunities for Improvement (OFI) through structured reviews of patient cases. Multidisciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews play a central role in this process, where clinicians from different specialities together analyse trauma cases to evaluate both the structure and clinical processes involved in trauma care following the Donabedian’s quality of care framework[@albaaj_patient_2023]. For shock patients, timely interventions such as fluid resuscitation/blood transfusion, intervention, OR and radiology are critical, and delays or missteps can result in adverse outcomes (källa). By systematically addressing OFIs, healthcare providers can improve the effectiveness of trauma care, directly impacting mortality and morbidity.

This study aims to describe the types of opportunities for improvement for adult trauma patients arriving in shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.


Methods 
=======

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->


We conducted a registry based retrospective cohort study, using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. We then linked the two databases to assess what types of OFI occurred in patients arriving in shock and use logistic regression to assess the association between the degree of shock and odds of opportunities for improvement. 


Setting
-------

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including
periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

The trauma registry includes about 14000 patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna between 2014 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review. The Karolinska University Hospital in Solna treats all major trauma in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm.  


Participants
------------

<!-- Cohort study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and
methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of
follow-up. For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of
exposed and unexposed -->

<!-- Case-control study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and + methods of case ascertainment and control
selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and
controls. For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number
of controls per case -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and methods of selection of participants -->

Every trauma patient at Karolinska University Hospital is included in a morbidity and mortality review process, which involves both individual case evaluations by specialized nurses and audit filters. Patients identified with a high potential for OFIs are discussed at multidisciplinary conferences. The identified OFIs are then categorized into broader areas. The multidisciplinary conferences are held every six to eight weeks, during which an average of ten patient cases are reviewed by experienced specialists from all trauma-related fields. The presence or absence of OFIs is determined by consensus among all participants and is documented in the trauma care quality database.

To qualify into the trauma registry, requires admission by trauma team activation or any admission with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of more than nine. We included all patients in ... between 2014 and 2023  We excluded patients younger than 15 and/or were dead on arrival. 


Variables and data sources/measurements
---------------------------------------

<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential
confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if
applicable. For each variable of interest, give sources of data and
details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability
of assessment methods if there is more than one group -->

<!-- Elaborate on the outcome OFI. How is it defined? What are the different types of OFI? -->

To classify the patients the following measurement will be used as independent variables for classification of shock regardless of their cause. Heart rate(HR), blood pressure(BP), respiratory rate(RR) and mental status. Based on these four measurements, the patients will be classified into four groups roughly based on the same value as in the ATLS trauma shock classifications. 

<!-- Elaborate on how you will categorise the degree of shock, what are the different levels?-->
The first group will be patients presenting with a HR below 100 beats per minute(BPM), respiratory rate between 14 to 20. The original ATLS classification only states normal BP, but no number. In our case, we will be using the systolic over 90mmhg as the lower limit up to 65 years old, and 110mmhg as the lower limit for patients older (geriatric patients). The...    

The outcome will be OFI recorded in the trauma care quality database and are binary when used to calculate the association with degree of shock. The subgroups of OFI will be explored and reported in a list, and therefore non-binary.
