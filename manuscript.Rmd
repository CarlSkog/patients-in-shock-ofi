1  Varför trauma är viktigt
    Mortalitet för unga
    Varför chock patienter är viktig subdel av akut omhändertagande av trauma pat
      Kanske (infoga källa) att chock är stor del av mortalitet.
      
Trauma is a major global public health concern in form of death and disability. It affects over four milion peole each year, among those younger and economicaly active(??) populations are the most affected(källa). The initial management of trauma patients once they reach hospital is very time sensitive and error prone(källa), especially in patients arriving in shock(källa). Therefore, careful studying of this part is of importance. 
      
2  Definiton av chock
    olika typer av chock: hypovolem, obstruktiv, neurogen, kardiogen och distributiv.
    trauma oftas de 3 första??

Shock are generally defined as circulatory failure leading to insuficient perfusion and oxygenation of tissue and organ[]. There are five types of causes, which are hypovolemia, obstructive, neurogenic, cardiogenic and distributive. These causes can occur alone or in combination. The most usuall one during trauma are hypovolemia in form of a large bleeding.

3  Klassifikationer av chock
    ATLS klassifikation för blödningschock.
      Hur ska jag ta med:
        Obstruktiv som tamponad?
        Neurogen som trauma mot halsrygg?
      RETTS och NEWS istället?? de används vid triage men är inte chock specifik.
    Kanske borde använda ATLS 4 kategorier + obstruktiv + neurogen vid sidan??
    
Clinically to be able to differentiate the degree of shock, usually the ATLS classification for major haemorrhage are used. The classification are divided into four classes, based on the patients: estimated bloodloss, heart rate, bloodpressure, pulse pressure, respiratory rate, mental status and urine output. However this only suits hypovolemic shocks and not the other types. 
    
4  Kliniskt för att förbättra omhändertagande används OFI
    Förklara vad OFI är för något
    
To be able to asses and improve the quality of trauma care, improvement programmes aim to identify opportunities for improvements(OFI). OFI is multidiciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews, where oppertunity for improvemetns are identified in the straucture and clinical process of trauma care(Hussein).  
    
5  Frågeställning:
    a, Vilka typer av OFI finns hos chockpatienter?
    b, Koppling mellan nivå av chock och sannolikhet till OFI.
    Vilken av de två är huvudfrågeställningen?
    PICO: Population: Chock pat, bland 8000 (2014-2023)
          Intervention: OFI?
          Comparison: mellan chocknivåer?
          Outcome: Sannolikhet till OFI?
      Det blir ju inte direkt någon ja/nej svar på frågeställningen...funkar det?
      
This study aims to describe the types of opportunities for improvement for adult trauma patients arriving in shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.



Methods 
=======

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->

Setting
-------

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including
periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

Participants
------------

<!-- Cohort study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and
methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of
follow-up. For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of
exposed and unexposed -->

sources and + methods of case ascertainment and control
selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and
controls. For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number
of controls per case -->

sources and methods of selection of participants -->

Variables and data sources/measurements
---------------------------------------

<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential
confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if
applicable. For each variable of interest, give sources of data and
details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability
of assessment methods if there is more than one group -->

----

<!-- Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias -->

Study size 
----------

<!-- Explain how the study size was arrived at -->

(c) Explain how missing data were addressed 

(d) 

Cohort study: If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed 

Case-control study:If applicable, explain how matching of cases and
controls was addressed

Cross-sectional study: If applicable, describe analytical methods
taking account of sampling strategy

-->

Results
=======

potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible,
included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed

(b) Give reasons for non-participation at each stage

(c) Consider use of a flow diagram

Descriptive data

clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential
confounders

variable of interest

(c) Cohort study — Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total
amount)

Outcome data
------------

Cohort study — Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures
over time

Case-control study — Report numbers in each exposure category, or
summary measures of exposure

Cross-sectional study — Report numbers of outcome events or summary
measures

Main results
------------

(a) Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted
estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make
clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included

(b) Report category boundaries when continuous variables were
categorized

(c) If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into
absolute risk for a meaningful time period

Other analyses 
--------------

Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions,
and sensitivity analyses

You can include code in this document like this:

```{r main, echo=FALSE}
source("main.R") ## This "imports" the main script file of your project and run any code in it
```

You can also embed plots:

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

You can also mix text and code, so called inline code, like this: `r 2+5`.
