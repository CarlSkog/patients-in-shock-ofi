1  Varför trauma är viktigt
    Mortalitet för unga
    Varför chock patienter är viktig subdel av akut omhändertagande av trauma pat
      Kanske (infoga källa) att chock är stor del av mortalitet.
      
Trauma is a major global public health concern in form of death and disability. It affects over four milion peole each year, among those younger and economicaly active(??) populations are the most affected(källa). The initial management of trauma patients once they reach hospital is very time sensitive and error prone(källa), especially in patients arriving in shock(källa). Therefore, careful studying of this part is of importance. 
      
2  Definiton av chock
    olika typer av chock: hypovolem, obstruktiv, neurogen, kardiogen och distributiv.
    trauma oftas de 3 första??

Shock are generally defined as circulatory failure leading to insuficient perfusion and oxygenation of tissue and organ[@leech_shock_2023]. There are five types of causes, which are hypovolemia, obstructive, neurogenic, cardiogenic and distributive. These causes can occur alone or in combination. The most usuall one during trauma are hypovolemia in form of a large bleeding.

3  Klassifikationer av chock
    ATLS klassifikation för blödningschock.
      Hur ska jag ta med:
        Obstruktiv som tamponad?
        Neurogen som trauma mot halsrygg?
      RETTS och NEWS istället?? de används vid triage men är inte chock specifik.
    Kanske borde använda ATLS 4 kategorier + obstruktiv + neurogen vid sidan??
    
Clinically to be able to differentiate the degree of shock, usually the ATLS classification for major haemorrhage are used. The classification are divided into four classes, based on the patients: estimated bloodloss, heart rate, bloodpressure, pulse pressure, respiratory rate, mental status and urine output. However this only suits hypovolemic shocks and not the other types. 
    
4  Kliniskt för att förbättra omhändertagande används OFI
    Förklara vad OFI är för något
    
To be able to asses and improve the quality of trauma care, improvement programmes aim to identify opportunities for improvements(OFI). OFI is multidiciplinary morbidity and mortality reviews, where oppertunity for improvemetns are identified in the stracture and clinical process of trauma care(Hussein).  
    
5  Frågeställning:
    a, Vilka typer av OFI finns hos chockpatienter?
    b, Koppling mellan nivå av chock och sannolikhet till OFI.
    Vilken av de två är huvudfrågeställningen?
    PICO: Population: Chock pat, bland 8000 (2014-2023)
          Intervention: OFI efter vård?
          Comparison: mellan chocknivåer?
          Outcome: Sannolikhet till OFI?
      Det blir ju inte direkt någon ja/nej svar på frågeställningen...funkar det?
      
This study aims to describe the types of opportunities for improvement for adult trauma patients arriving in shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.



Methods 
=======

Study design
------------

<!-- Present key elements of study design -->

We conducted a registry based retrospective cohort study, using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. We then linked the two databases to assess what types of OFI occurred in patients arriving in shock and use adjusted logistic regression to assess the association between the degree of shock and odds of opportunities for improvement. 

Setting
-------

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including
periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

The trauma registry includes about 14000 patients treated at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna between 2012 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2023. Karolinska University Hospital in Solna acts as a level one trauma center according to critera set by American College of Surgeons(), and treats all major trauma in the greater metropolitan area of Stockholm.  

Participants
------------

<!-- Cohort study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and
methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of
follow-up. For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of
exposed and unexposed -->

<!-- Case-control study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and + methods of case ascertainment and control
selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and
controls. For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number
of controls per case -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study: Give the eligibility criteria, and the
sources and methods of selection of participants -->

Every trauma patient at Karolinska University Hospital is included in a morbidity and mortality review process, which involves both individual case evaluations by specialized nurses and audit filters. Patients identified with a high potential for OFIs are discussed at multidisciplinary conferences. The identified OFIs are then categorized into broader areas. The multidisciplinary conferences are held every six to eight weeks, during which an average of ten patient cases are reviewed by experienced specialists from all trauma-related fields. The presence or absence of OFIs is determined by consensus among all participants and is documented in the trauma care quality database.

To qualify into the trauma registry, requires admission by trauma team activation or any admission with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) of more than nine. We included all patients in ... between ... and ... We excluded patients younger than 18 and/or were dead on arrival. 

Variables and data sources/measurements
---------------------------------------

<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential
confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if
applicable. For each variable of interest, give sources of data and
details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability
of assessment methods if there is more than one group -->

The outcome is OFI recorded in the trauma care quality database and are binary (as in yes exist or no does not exist) when used to calculate the association with degree of shock. 
The subgroups of OFI will be explored and reported in a list, and therefore non-binary.

To classify the patients the following variables will be used: estimated bloodloss, heart rate, bloodpressure, pulse pressure, respiratory rate, mental status and urine output.
