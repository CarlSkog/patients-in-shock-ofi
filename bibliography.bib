	abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary aim was to determine whether a shock index (SI) ≥ 1 in adult trauma patients was associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared to an SI {\textless} 1.
METHODS: This systematic review including a meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were searched, and two authors independently screened articles, performed the data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. Studies were included if they reported in-hospital, 30-day, or 48-h mortality, length of stay, massive blood transfusion or ICU admission in trauma patients with SI recorded at arrival in the emergency department or trauma center. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the strength and quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohen's kappa.
RESULTS: We screened 1350 citations with an inter-rater reliability of 0.90. Thirty-eight cohort studies were included of which 14 reported the primary outcome. All studies reported a significant higher in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients with an SI ≥ 1 compared to those having an SI {\textless} 1. Twelve studies involving a total of 348,687 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of in-hospital mortality was 4.15 (95\% CI 2.96-5.83). The overall quality of evidence was low.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found a fourfold increased risk of in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients with an initial SI ≥ 1 in the emergency department or trauma center.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the preventable and potentially preventable deaths occurring at a mature Level I trauma center.
METHODS: All trauma patients that died during their initial hospital admission during an 8-year period (January, 1998 to December, 2005) were analyzed. The deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M\&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury, probability of survival with Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths), errors in the evaluation and management of the patient, and classification of errors (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details, clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual chart review.
RESULTS: During the study period, 35,311 patients meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of 2,081 (5.9\%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1\% of admissions, 2.5\% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53\% of deaths) were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92\% of deaths) as potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7\% were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5\% were blunt. The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2\%) followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5\%) and cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6\%). This was caused by a delay in treatment (27, 52.9\%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6\%), missed diagnosis (6, 11.8\%), technical error (4, 7.8\%), and other (3, 5.9\%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26 (51.1\%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4\%) after 7 days. Only one patient (2.0\%) died in the first hour. The most common location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9\%), operating room (13, 25.5\%), and emergency room (5, 9.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center. Delay in treatment and error in judgment are the leading causes of preventable and potentially preventable deaths.},

	doi = {10.1097/TA.0b013e31809ed924},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinicians routinely refer to hypotension as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textless} or =90 mm Hg. However, few data exist to support the rigid adherence to this arbitrary cutoff. We hypothesized that the physiologic hypoperfusion and mortality outcomes classically associated with hypotension were manifest at higher SBPs.
METHODS: A total of 870,634 patient records from the National Trauma Data Bank with emergency department SBP and mortality data were analyzed. Patients (140,898) with severe head injuries, a Glasgow Coma Score {\textless} or =8, and base deficit (BD) {\textless}5, or missing data items were excluded from analysis. Admission BD, as a measure of metabolic hypoperfusion, was evaluated in 81,134 patients and mortality was plotted against SBP.
RESULTS: Baseline mortality was {\textless}2.5\%. However, at 110 mm Hg, the slope of the mortality curve increased such that mortality was 4.8\% greater for every 10-mm Hg decrement in SBP. This effect was consistent to a maximum of 26\% mortality at a SBP of 60 mm Hg. Hypoperfusion (change in the slope of BD curve) began to increase above baseline of 4.5 at a SBP 118 mm Hg.
CONCLUSION: Taking the BD and mortality measurements together, this analysis shows that a SBP {\textless} or =110 mm Hg is a more clinically relevant definition of hypotension and hypoperfusion than is 90 mm Hg. This analysis will also be useful for developing appropriately powered studies of hemorrhagic shock.},

	shorttitle = {Redefining hypotension in the elderly},
	doi = {10.1001/archsurg.2011.154},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent debate concerns the most appropriate definition of hypotension. Some have advocated raising the systolic blood pressure (BP) threshold to 110 mm Hg while others favor 80 mm Hg.
HYPOTHESIS: The optimal definition of hypotension differs by age group.
DESIGN: An analysis was performed of trauma victims 18 years and older in the National Trauma Data Bank, excluding burn injury patients and those with incomplete data.
SETTING: Injured patients who were hospitalized in various trauma centers across the continental United States.
PATIENTS: Three age groups were identified for analysis as follows: 18 to 35 years, 36 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. One hundred one multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for each population. Hypotension was sequentially defined as an emergency department systolic BP (SBP) of 50 to 150 mm Hg to see which model best predicted mortality, adjusting for demographic and injury covariates. The discriminatory power of each model was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Optimally defined hypotension was identified as the model with the highest AUROC curve.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: In-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 902,852 patients (median age, 44 years; 66.2\% men) were analyzed. Overall mortality was 4.1\%. Optimal emergency department SBP cutoff values for hypotension were 85 mm Hg for patients aged 18 to 35 years, 96 mm Hg for patients aged 36 to 64 years, and 117 mm Hg for elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients younger than 65 years, the classic definition of hypotension as an emergency department SBP less than 90 mm Hg remains optimal. With increasing involvement of elderly individuals in trauma and their peculiarity as a comorbid state, there is a need to redefine what is presently defined as a cutoff value for hypotension in elderly patients.},

Our objective was to determine if patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg have a worse outcome than patients with a higher SBP following trauma. Patients with gastric, small bowel, and/or diaphragm injuries were identified retrospectively through the trauma database from 1980-2003. All 2071 patients underwent emergent laparotomy at an urban, level one trauma center. The mortality rate of patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg in the ED or OR was 5\% (17/354) and significantly higher than the 1\% (12/1020) mortality seen in patients with a SBP of 110 mmHg or greater (P{\textless}0.001). The average length of stay of patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg was 15+/-14 days and was significantly longer than the 11+/-11 days seen in patients with a higher SBP. If the SBP was 90-109 mmHg, the infection rate was 39\% (131/340), and this was significantly higher than the 22\% (219/1016) infection rate seen in patients with higher SBP (P{\textless}0.001). Trauma patients with a systolic blood pressure of 109 mmHg or below are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality following trauma. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 90-109 mmHg following trauma should be considered as a special group requiring aggressive resuscitation and surgery. Early operative control of hemorrhage in these patients can reduce mortality and infection.},

	abstract = {Studies of 4590 patients with blunt trauma injuries admitted to a Level I Trauma Center, have shown that 37\% had a blunt traumatic brain injury (BTBI). Of these brain injured patients 60\% has an associated other injury. Examination of mortality has shown that those with an isolated brain injury had an 11\% mortality compared with 21.8\% in those with an associated systemic injury. Further investigation demonstrated that the cause of the increased mortality was related to the blood loss associated with the injuries and that when hypovolemic shock resulted, mortality rose from 12.8 to 62\%. The severity of the associated injuries effect on the brain injured patient could be estimated by a parameter of oxygen debt, the base deficit and this allowed for a quantitative estimate of the probability of death as an index of severity. A combined linear logistic model using the admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) as a measure of brain injury and the base deficit as a measure of physiologic injury provides such a predictive score. The effect of associated injuries in patients with moderate brain injury (AIS 2,3) was to increase the average total cost of medical care in the first year of injury by three-fold (\$12,489 to \$36,177) and for severe brain injury (AIS 4,5) to increase average cost from \$59,000 in isolated BTBI to \$90,000 in BTBI with associated injury. The high incidence of brain injuries in motor vehicle crashes (MVC) caused by lateral impacts and their association with other side-impact injuries (lungs, spleen, kidney, and pelvic fractures) in which large blood volume losses are common, focuses attention on the need for side impact protection standards that simultaneously protect brain, thoracoabdominal viscera, and pelvis as a means of reducing the severity and cost of lateral impact MVCs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A computer-based system to apply trauma resuscitation protocols to patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma was previously validated for 97 consecutive patients at a Level 1 trauma center by a panel of the trauma attendings and further refined by a panel of national trauma experts. The purpose of this article is to describe how this system is now used to objectively critique the actual care given to those patients for process errors in reasoning, independent of outcome.
METHODS: A chronological narrative of the care of each patient was presented to the computer program. The actual care was compared with the validated computer protocols at each decision point and differences were classified by a predetermined scoring system from 0 to 100, based on the potential impact on outcome, as critical/noncritical/no errors of commission, omission, or procedure selection.
RESULTS: Errors in reasoning occurred in 100\% of the 97 cases studied, averaging 11.9/case. Errors of omission were more prevalent than errors of commission (2. 4 errors/case vs 1.2) and were of greater severity (19.4/error vs 5. 1). The largest number of errors involved the failure to record, and perhaps observe, beside information relevant to the reasoning process, an average of 7.4 missing items/patient. Only 2 of the 10 adverse outcomes were judged to be potentially related to errors of reasoning.
CONCLUSIONS: Process errors in reasoning were ubiquitous, occurring in every case, although they were infrequently judged to be potentially related to an adverse outcome. Errors of omission were assessed to be more severe. The most common error was failure to consider, or document, available relevant information in the selection of appropriate care.},

We undertook a review of trauma management errors at our institution with maximal impact (death). The analysis was based on the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) taxonomy.
METHODS: Trauma deaths between 2001 and 2006 at our Level I trauma were peer-reviewed to identify errors in management. The errors are classified according to type, domain, and cause.
RESULTS: Seventy-six (9.9\%) of 764 deaths had management errors contributing to potentially preventable deaths in 60 (errors in management might have contributed to death) and preventable deaths (management errors definitely contributed to death) in 16 patients. Questionable resuscitation was the commonest type and involved poor treatment in the majority. Errors were made in all domains but most commonly in the emergency department and the operating room and in the resuscitative phase. Human errors predominated.
CONCLUSIONS: Management errors in the basics of trauma care continue even in established trauma centers, despite guidelines, protocols, and continuous performance improvement. Standardized reporting such as the taxonomy may result in progressive collection of patient safety data and lead to innovations to minimize these errors.},

Twelve percent of the global disease burden is the result of violence or accidental injury. Hemorrhage is responsible for 30 to 40\% of trauma mortality, and of these deaths, 33 to 56\% occur during the prehospital period. Among those who reach care, early mortality is caused by continued hemorrhage, coagulopathy, and incomplete resuscitation. The techniques of early care, including blood transfusion, may underlie late mortality and long-term morbidity. While the volume of blood lost cannot be measured, physiologic and chemical measures and the number of units of blood given are readily recorded and analyzed. Improvements in early hemorrhage control and resuscitation and the prevention and aggressive treatment of coagulopathy appear to have the greatest potential to improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.},

	abstract = {Before assessment can begin we must decide how quality is to be defined and that depends on whether one assesses only the performance of practitioners or also the contributions of patients and of the health care system; on how broadly health and responsibility for health are defined; on whether the maximally effective or optimally effective care is sought; and on whether individual or social preferences define the optimum. We also need detailed information about the causal linkages among the structural attributes of the settings in which care occurs, the processes of care, and the outcomes of care. Specifying the components or outcomes of care to be sampled, formulating the appropriate criteria and standards, and obtaining the necessary information are the steps that follow. Though we know much about assessing quality, much remains to be known.(JAMA 1988;260:1743-1748)},

METHODS: Admission physiology, injury and outcome variables from adult injured patients presenting to hospitals in England and Wales between 1989 and 2007 and stored on the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database, were studied. For each patient, the blood loss was estimated and patients were divided into four groups based on the estimated blood loss corresponding to the ATLS classes of shock. The median and interquartile ranges (IQR) of the heart rate (HR) systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were calculated for each group.
RESULTS: The median HR rose from 82 beats per minute (BPM) in estimated class 1 shock to 95 BPM in estimated class 4 shock. The median SBP fell from 135 mm Hg to 120 mm Hg. There was no significant change in RR or GCS.
CONCLUSION: With increasing estimated blood loss there is a trend to increasing heart rate and a reduction in SBP but not to the degree suggested by the ATLS classification of shock.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determination of the need for massive transfusion (MT) is essential for early activation of a MT protocol. The Traumatic Bleeding Severity Score (TBSS) predicts the need for MT accurately, but takes time to determine because systolic blood pressure after a 1000mL of crystalloid infusion is used. The aim of this study is to determine the how well the Modified TBSS (age, sonography, pelvic fracture, serum lactate and systolic blood pressure on arrival) predicts the need for MT (accuracy).
METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of trauma patients (Injury Severity Score ≧16) admitted between 2010 and 2014. The TBSS, the Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage (TASH) Score, and the Modified TBSS were calculated. MT is defined as ≧10 U packed red blood cell transfusion within 24hours of injury, and the predictive value of the need for MT was compared by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis among three scores.
RESULTS: Three hundred patients were enrolled, and MT given to 25\% of patients. Although the AUC of the TBSS was higher than that of the TASH score (0.956 vs 0.912, P=.006) and the Modified TBSS (0.956 vs 0.915, P=.001), there was no difference between the AUC of the Modified TBSS and the TASH score. The Modified TBSS has high accuracy, within an AUC {\textgreater}0.9.
CONCLUSION: The predictive value of the Modified TBSS of the need for MT is still high and is equivalent to the TASH score. The Modified TBSS is calculated earlier in resuscitation than the original TBSS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To develop a simple scoring system that allows an early and reliable estimation for the probability of mass transfusion (MT) as a surrogate for life threatening hemorrhage following multiple trauma.
METHODS: Potential clinical and laboratory variables documented in the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society (DGU) (1993-2003; n=17,200) were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the probability for MT.
RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory variables available from data sets were screened for their association with mass transfusion. MT was defined by transfusion requirement of {\textgreater}or=10 units of packed red blood cells from emergency room (ER) to intensive care unit admission. Seven independent variables were identified to be significantly correlated with an increased probability for MT: systolic blood pressure ({\textless}100 mm Hg=4 pts, {\textless}120 mm Hg=1 pt), hemoglobin ({\textless}7 g/dL=8 pts, {\textless}9 g/dL=6 pts, {\textless}10 g/dL=4 pts, {\textless}11 g/dL=3 pts, and {\textless}12 g/dL=2 pts), intra-abdominal fluid (3 pts), complex long bone and/or pelvic fractures (AIS 3/4=3 pts and AIS 5=6 pts), heart rate ({\textgreater}120=2 pts), base excess ({\textless}-10 mmol/L=4 pts, {\textless}-6 mmol/L=3 pts, and {\textless}-2 mmol/L=1 pt), and gender (male=1 pt). These variables were incorporated into a risk score, the Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage Score (TASH-Score, 0-28 points). Performance of the score was tested with respect to discrimination, precision, and calibration. Increasing TASH-Score points were associated with an increasing probability for MT.
CONCLUSION: The TASH-Score is an easy-to-use scoring system that reliably predicts the probability for MT after multiple trauma. Taken as a surrogate for life threatening bleeding calculation may focus attention on relevant variables indicative for risk and impact strategies to stop bleeding and stabilize coagulation in acute trauma care.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score is a previously validated scoring system designed to predict which severely injured trauma patients will require massive transfusion. When the ABC score is used in the prehospital setting to activate massive transfusion at the receiving hospital, a 23\% decrease in mortality has been demonstrated. However, the ABC score was developed and validated using hospital data from the emergency department (ED). The sensitivity and specificity of the ABC score when calculated using data from the prehospital setting are unknown. We hypothesized that the sensitivity and specificity of the prehospital ABC score will be similar to the sensitivity and specificity of the ED ABC score.
METHODS: A 5-year retrospective analysis (2015-2019) of highest-activation adult trauma patients arriving to a quaternary Level I trauma center by hospital-based helicopter air medical service (HEMS) was performed. Demographic, prehospital, ED triage, and blood product utilization data were collected. Prehospital ABC score was calculated using the highest heart rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam results obtained prior to arrival at the trauma center. ED ABC score was calculated using ED triage vital signs and ED FAST results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve were calculated for each ABC score.
RESULTS: 2,067 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age 39 (±17) years, 76\% male, 22\% penetrating mechanism. Of these, 128 patients (6\%) received massive transfusion using the definition from the original study. Prehospital ABC score at a cutoff of 2 was 51\% sensitive and 85\% specific for predicting massive transfusion, with 83\% correctly classified and an AUROC = 0.73. ED ABC score at the same cutoff was 60\% sensitive and 84\% specific, with 83\% correctly classified and an AUROC = 0.81. By logistic regression, the odds of massive transfusion increased by 2.76 for every 1-point increase in prehospital ABC score (95\%CI 2.25-3.37, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ABC score is a useful prehospital tool for identifying who will require massive transfusion. Future studies to evaluate the effect of the prehospital ABC score on clinical care and mortality are necessary.},

	abstract = {Introduction: An assessment of physiological status is a key step in the early assessment of trauma patients with implications for triage, investigation and management. This has traditionally been done using vital signs. Previous work from large European trauma datasets has suggested that base deficit (BD) predicts clinically important outcomes better than vital signs (VS). A BD derived classification of haemorrhagic shock appeared superior to one based on VS derived from ATLS criteria in a population of predominantly blunt trauma patients. The initial aim of this study was to see if this observation would be reproduced in penetrating trauma patients. The power of each individual variable (BD, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), shock index(SI) (HR/SBP) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)) to predict mortality was then also compared. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult trauma patients presenting to the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service was performed. Patients were classified into four “shock” groups using VS or BD and the outcomes compared. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were then generated to compare the predictive power for mortality of each individual variable. Results: 1863 patients were identified. The overall mortality rate was 2.1\%. When classified by BD, HR rose and SBP fell as the “shock class” increased but not to the degree suggested by the ATLS classification. The BD classification of haemorrhagic shock appeared to predict mortality better than that based on the ATLS criteria. Mortality increased from 0.2\% (Class 1) to 19.7\% (Class 4) based on the 4 level BD classification. Mortality increased from 0.3\% (Class 1) to 12.6\% (Class 4) when classified based by VS. Area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis of the individual variables demonstrated that BD predicted mortality significantly better than HR, GCS, SBP and SI. AUROC curve (95\% Confidence Interval (CI)) for BD was 0.90 (0.85-0.95) compared to HR 0.67(0.56-0.77), GCS 0.70(0.62-0.79), SBP 0.75(0.65-0.85) and SI 0.77(0.68–0.86). Conclusion: BD appears superior to vital signs in the immediate physiological assessment of penetrating trauma patients. The use of BD to assess physiological status may help refine their early triage, investigation and management.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify causes and timing of mortality in trauma patients to determine targets for future studies.
BACKGROUND: In trials conducted by the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium in patients with traumatic hypovolemic shock (shock) or traumatic brain injury (TBI), hypertonic saline failed to improve survival. Selecting appropriate candidates is challenging.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients enrolled in multicenter, randomized trials performed from 2006 to 2009. Inclusion criteria were as follows: injured patients, age 15 years or more with hypovolemic shock [systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤ 70 mm Hg or SBP 71-90 mm Hg with heart rate ≥ 108) or severe TBI [Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) ≤ 8]. Initial fluid administered was 250 mL of either 7.5\% saline with 6\% dextran 70, 7.5\% saline or 0.9\% saline.
RESULTS: A total of 2061 subjects were enrolled (809 shock, 1252 TBI) and 571 (27.7\%) died. Survivors were younger than nonsurvivors [30 (interquartile range 23) vs 42 (34)] and had a higher GCS, though similar hemodynamics. Most deaths occurred despite ongoing resuscitation. Forty-six percent of deaths in the TBI cohort were within 24 hours, compared with 82\% in the shock cohort and 72\% in the cohort with both shock and TBI. Median time to death was 29 hours in the TBI cohort, 2 hours in the shock cohort, and 4 hours in patients with both. Sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction accounted for 2\% of deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Most deaths from trauma with shock or TBI occur within 24 hours from hypovolemic shock or TBI. Novel resuscitation strategies should focus on early deaths, though prevention may have a greater impact.},

To promote greater use of effective QI programs, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for Trauma Surgery and Intensive Care (IATSIC) have been collaboratively developing the upcoming Guidelines for Trauma Quality Improvement Programmes. As part of the development of this publication and to satisfy global demands for WHO guidelines to be evidence based, we conducted a thorough literature search on the effectiveness of trauma QI programs.
METHODS: The review was based on a PubMed search of all articles reporting an outcome from a trauma QI program.
RESULTS: Thirty-six articles were identified that reported results of evaluations of a trauma QI program or in which the trauma QI program was integrally related to identification and correction of specific problems. Thirteen of these articles reported on mortality as their main outcome; 12 reported on changes in morbidity (infection rates, complications), patient satisfaction, costs, or other outcomes of tangible patient benefit; and 11 reported on changes in process of care. Thirty articles addressed hospital-based care; four system-wide care; and two prehospital care. Thirty-four articles reported an improvement in the outcome assessed; two reported no change; and none reported worsening of the outcome. Five articles also reported cost savings.
CONCLUSIONS: Trauma QI programs are consistently shown to improve the process of care, decrease mortality, and decrease costs. Further efforts to promote trauma QI globally are warranted. These findings support the further development and promulgation of the WHO-IATSIC Guidelines for Trauma QI Programmes.},

Whereas new investments are welcome, quality improvement (QI) at the currently available trauma care facilities is essential. The objective of this study was to determine the effect and long-term sustainability of trauma QI initiatives on in-hospital mortality and complications at a large tertiary hospital in a developing country.
METHODS: In 2002, a specialized trauma team was formed (members trained using advanced trauma life support), and a western style trauma program established including a registry and quality assurance program. Patients from 1998 onward were entered in to this registry, enabling a preimplementation and postimplementation study. Adults ({\textgreater}15 years) with blunt or penetrating trauma were analyzed. The main outcomes of interest were (1) in-hospital mortality and (2) occurrence of any complication. Multiple logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of formalized trauma care on outcomes, controlling for covariates reaching significance in the bivariate analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 1,227 patient records were analyzed. Patient demographics and injury characteristics are described in Table 1. Overall in-hospital mortality rate was 6.4\%, and the complication rate was 11.1\%. On multivariate analysis, patients admitted during the trauma service years were 4.9 times less likely to die (95\% confidence interval, 1.77-13.57) and 2.60 times (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval, 1.29-5.21) less likely to have a complication compared with those treated in the pretrauma service years.
CONCLUSION: Despite significant delays in hospital transit and lack of prehospital trauma care, hospital level implementation of trauma QI program greatly decreases mortality and complication rates in the developing world.

	abstract = {Background
A severe mismatch between the supply and demand of oxygen is the common feature of all types of shock. We present a newly developed, clinically oriented classification of the various types of shock and their therapeutic implications.

Methods
This review is based on pertinent publications (1990–2018) retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, and on the relevant guidelines and meta-analyses.

Results
There are only four major categories of shock, each of which is mainly related to one of four organ systems. Hypovolemic shock relates to the blood and fluids compartment while distributive shock relates to the vascular system; cardiogenic shock arises from primary cardiac dysfunction; and obstructive shock arises from a blockage of the circulation. Hypovolemic shock is due to intravascular volume loss and is treated by fluid replacement with balanced crystalloids. Distributive shock, on the other hand, is a state of relative hypovolemia resulting from pathological redistribution of the absolute intravascular volume and is treated with a combination of vasoconstrictors and fluid replacement. Cardiogenic shock is due to inadequate function of the heart, which shall be treated, depending on the situation, with drugs, surgery, or other interventional procedures. In obstructive shock, hypoperfusion due to elevated resistance shall be treated with an immediate life-saving intervention.

Conclusion
The new classification is intended to facilitate the goal-driven treatment of shock in both the pre-hospital and the inpatient setting. A uniform treatment strategy should be established for each of the four types of shock.},

The most common organs injured are the small bowel (50\%), large bowel (40\%), liver (30\%), and intra-abdominal vascular (25\%). When the injury is close range, there is more kinetic energy than those injuries sustained from a distance. Even though most gunshot wounds typically have a linear projection, high-energy wounds are associated with unpredictable injuries. There may also be secondary missile injuries from bone or bullet fragments. Stab wounds that penetrate the abdominal wall are difficult to assess. Occult injuries can be missed, resulting in delayed complications that can add to the morbidity.[1][2][3]},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Injury deaths in sub-Saharan Africa are among the world's highest, but hospital data rarely have sufficient granularity to direct quality improvement. We analyzed clinical care patterns among trauma patients who died in a prospective, multicenter sub-Saharan cohort to pinpoint trauma quality improvement intervention targets.
METHODS: In-hospital trauma deaths in four Cameroonian hospitals between 2017 and 2019 were included. Trauma registry data on patient demographics, injury characteristics, and clinical care were analyzed to identify opportunities for systems improvements.
RESULTS: Among 9,423 trauma patients, there were 236 deaths. Overall, 83\% of patients who died in the emergency department were living on arrival (LOA). Among 183 LOA patients, 30\% presented with normal vital signs, but 11\% had no vital signs taken, often because of lack of equipment (43\%). Of LOA patients presenting with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of {\textless}9 (56\%), few received neurosurgery consults (15\%), C-collar placement (9\%), or intubation (1\%). The most common reason for lack of c-collar placement was failure to recognize that it was indicated (66\%). Tracheal deviation, unequal breath sounds, or paradoxical chest movement were present in 63\% of LOA patients, but only two patients had chest tubes placed. Hypotension or active bleeding was present in 80\% of LOA patients; while crystalloid bolus was given to 96\% of these patients, few received transfusion (8\%), tourniquet placement for extremity injury (6\%), or an operation (4\%).
CONCLUSION: Primary survey interventions are underperformed in trauma nonsurvivors in Cameroon. Protocolizing early treatment for head injury, hemorrhagic shock, and chest wall trauma could reduce trauma mortality.

	doi = {10.1097/SHK.0000000000001359},
	abstract = {Background: 
          Uncontrolled bleeding is the main cause of the potential preventable death in trauma patients. Accordingly, we reviewed all the existing scores for massive transfusion posttraumatic hemorrhage and summarized their characteristics, thus making it easier for the reader to have a global view of these scores—how they were created, their accuracy and to which population they apply.
          Methods: 
          A narrative review with a systematic search method to retrieve the journal articles on the predictive scores or models for massive transfusion was carried out. A literature search using PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google scholar was performed using relevant keywords in different combinations. The keywords used were “massive transfusion,” “score,” “model,” “trauma,” and “hemorrhage” in different combinations. The search was limited for full-text articles published in English language, human species and for the duration from January 1, 1998 to November 30, 2018.
          Results: 
          The database search yielded 295 articles. The search was then restricted to the inclusion criteria which retrieved 241 articles. Duplicates were removed and full-texts were assessed for the eligibility to include in the review which resulted in inclusion of 24 articles. These articles identified 24 scoring systems including modified or revised scores. Different models and scores for identifying patients requiring massive transfusion in military and civilian settings have been described. Many of these scorings were complex with difficult calculation, while some were simple and easy to remember.
          Conclusions: 
          The current prevailing practice that is best described as institutional or provider centered should be supplemented with score-based protocol with auditing and monitoring tools to refine it. This review summarizes the current scoring models in predicting the need for MT in civilian and military trauma. Several questions remain open; i.e., do we need to develop new score, merge scores, modify scores, or adopt existing score for certain trauma setting?},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: For the early recognition and management of hypovolaemic shock, ATLS suggests four shock classes based upon an estimated blood loss in percent. The aim of this study was to assess the confidence and acceptance of the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock among ATLS course directors and instructors in daily trauma care.
METHODS: During a 2-month period, ATLS course directors and instructors from the ATLS region XV (Europe) were invited to participate in an online survey comprising 15 questions.
RESULTS: A total of 383 responses were received. Ninety-eight percent declared that they would follow the 'A, B, C, D, E' approach by ATLS in daily trauma care. However, only 48\% assessed 'C-Circulation' according to the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock. One out of four respondents estimated that in daily clinical routine, less than 50\% of all trauma patients can be classified according to the current ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock. Additionally, only 10.9\% considered the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock as a 'good guide' for fluid resuscitation and blood product transfusion, whereas 45.1\% stated that this classification only 'may help' or has 'no impact' to guide resuscitation strategies.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the 'A, B, C, D, E' approach according to ATLS is widely implemented in daily trauma care, the use of the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock in daily practice is limited. Together with previous analyses, this study supports the need for a critical reassessment of the current ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock.},

	abstract = {Aim
The aim of this study was to validate the classification of hypovolaemic shock given by the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS).
Methods
Patients derived from the TraumaRegister DGU® database between 2002 and 2010 were analyzed. First, patients were allocated into the four classes of hypovolaemic shock by matching the combination of heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) according to ATLS. Second, patients were classified by only one parameter (HR, SBP or GCS) according to the ATLS classification and the corresponding changes of the remaining two parameters were assessed within these four groups. Analyses of demographic, injury and therapy characteristics were performed as well.
Results
36,504 patients were identified for further analysis. Only 3411 patients (9.3\%) could be adequately classified according to ATLS, whereas 33,093 did not match the combination of all three criteria given by ATLS. When patients were grouped by HR, there was only a slight reduction of SBP associated with tachycardia. The median GCS declined from 12 to 3. When grouped by SBP, GCS dropped from 13 to 3 while there was no relevant tachycardia observed in any group. Patients with a GCS=15 presented normotensive and with a HR of 88/min, whereas patients with a GCS{\textless}12 showed a slight reduced SBP of 117mmHg and HR was unaltered.
Conclusion
This study indicates that the ATLS classification of hypovolaemic shock does not seem to reflect clinical reality accurately.},

Deaths from haemorrhage were identified and subjected to qualitative and quantitative evaluation. OPIs were identified and remedial action was taken.During the study interval there were 7511 trauma team activations; 423 patients died. Haemorrhage was the second most common cause of death, in 112 patients, and made a substantial contribution to death in a further 15. For 84 of these 127 patients, a total of 150 OPIs were identified. Most arose in the emergency department, but involved personnel from many departments. Problems with decision-making were more common than errors in technical skill. OPIs frequently involved the decision between surgery, radiology and further investigation. Delayed and inappropriate surgery occurred even when investigation and diagnosis were appropriate. The mortality rate among patients presenting in shock fell significantly over the study interval (P \&lt; 0·026).Problems with judgement are more common than those of skill. Death from traumatic haemorrhage is associated with identifiable, remediable failures in care.

	abstract = {Background
Monitoring the quality of trauma care is frequently done by analysing the preventability of trauma deaths and errors during trauma care. In the Academic Medical Center trauma deaths are discussed during a monthly Morbidity and Mortality meeting. In this study an external multidisciplinary panel assessed the trauma deaths and errors in management of a Dutch Level-1 trauma centre for (potential) preventability.
Methods
All patients who died during or after presentation in the trauma resuscitation room in a 2-year period were eligible for review. All information on trauma evaluation and management was summarised by an independent research fellow. An external multidisciplinary panel individually evaluated the cases for preventability of death. Potential errors or mismanagements during the admission were classified for type, phase and domain. Overall agreement on (potential) preventability was compared between the external panel and the internal M\&M consensus.
Results
Of the 62 evaluated trauma deaths one was judged as preventable and 17 were judged as potentially preventable by the review panel. Overall agreement on preventability between the review panel and the internal consensus was moderate (Kappa 0.51). The external panel judged one death as preventable compared with three from the internal consensus. The interobserver agreement between the external panel members was also moderate (Kappa 0.43). The panel judged 31 errors to have occurred in the (potential) preventable death group and 23 errors in the non-preventable death group. Such errors included choice or sequence of diagnostics, rewarming of hypothermic patients, and correction of coagulopathies.
Conclusions
The preventable death rate in the present study was comparable to data in the available literature. Compared to internal review, the external, multidisciplinary review did not find a higher preventable death rate, although it provided several insights to optimise trauma care.},
