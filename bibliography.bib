	abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary aim was to determine whether a shock index (SI) ≥ 1 in adult trauma patients was associated with increased in-hospital mortality compared to an SI {\textless} 1.
METHODS: This systematic review including a meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were searched, and two authors independently screened articles, performed the data extraction, and assessed risk of bias. Studies were included if they reported in-hospital, 30-day, or 48-h mortality, length of stay, massive blood transfusion or ICU admission in trauma patients with SI recorded at arrival in the emergency department or trauma center. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and the strength and quality of the body of evidence according to GRADE. Data were pooled using a random effects model. Inter-rater reliability was assessed with Cohen's kappa.
RESULTS: We screened 1350 citations with an inter-rater reliability of 0.90. Thirty-eight cohort studies were included of which 14 reported the primary outcome. All studies reported a significant higher in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients with an SI ≥ 1 compared to those having an SI {\textless} 1. Twelve studies involving a total of 348,687 participants were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) of in-hospital mortality was 4.15 (95\% CI 2.96-5.83). The overall quality of evidence was low.
CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found a fourfold increased risk of in-hospital mortality in adult trauma patients with an initial SI ≥ 1 in the emergency department or trauma center.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the preventable and potentially preventable deaths occurring at a mature Level I trauma center.
METHODS: All trauma patients that died during their initial hospital admission during an 8-year period (January, 1998 to December, 2005) were analyzed. The deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M\&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury, probability of survival with Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths), errors in the evaluation and management of the patient, and classification of errors (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details, clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual chart review.
RESULTS: During the study period, 35,311 patients meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of 2,081 (5.9\%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1\% of admissions, 2.5\% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53\% of deaths) were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92\% of deaths) as potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7\% were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5\% were blunt. The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2\%) followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5\%) and cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6\%). This was caused by a delay in treatment (27, 52.9\%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6\%), missed diagnosis (6, 11.8\%), technical error (4, 7.8\%), and other (3, 5.9\%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26 (51.1\%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4\%) after 7 days. Only one patient (2.0\%) died in the first hour. The most common location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9\%), operating room (13, 25.5\%), and emergency room (5, 9.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center. Delay in treatment and error in judgment are the leading causes of preventable and potentially preventable deaths.},

	doi = {10.1097/TA.0b013e31809ed924},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Clinicians routinely refer to hypotension as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) {\textless} or =90 mm Hg. However, few data exist to support the rigid adherence to this arbitrary cutoff. We hypothesized that the physiologic hypoperfusion and mortality outcomes classically associated with hypotension were manifest at higher SBPs.
METHODS: A total of 870,634 patient records from the National Trauma Data Bank with emergency department SBP and mortality data were analyzed. Patients (140,898) with severe head injuries, a Glasgow Coma Score {\textless} or =8, and base deficit (BD) {\textless}5, or missing data items were excluded from analysis. Admission BD, as a measure of metabolic hypoperfusion, was evaluated in 81,134 patients and mortality was plotted against SBP.
RESULTS: Baseline mortality was {\textless}2.5\%. However, at 110 mm Hg, the slope of the mortality curve increased such that mortality was 4.8\% greater for every 10-mm Hg decrement in SBP. This effect was consistent to a maximum of 26\% mortality at a SBP of 60 mm Hg. Hypoperfusion (change in the slope of BD curve) began to increase above baseline of 4.5 at a SBP 118 mm Hg.
CONCLUSION: Taking the BD and mortality measurements together, this analysis shows that a SBP {\textless} or =110 mm Hg is a more clinically relevant definition of hypotension and hypoperfusion than is 90 mm Hg. This analysis will also be useful for developing appropriately powered studies of hemorrhagic shock.},

	shorttitle = {Redefining hypotension in the elderly},
	doi = {10.1001/archsurg.2011.154},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent debate concerns the most appropriate definition of hypotension. Some have advocated raising the systolic blood pressure (BP) threshold to 110 mm Hg while others favor 80 mm Hg.
HYPOTHESIS: The optimal definition of hypotension differs by age group.
DESIGN: An analysis was performed of trauma victims 18 years and older in the National Trauma Data Bank, excluding burn injury patients and those with incomplete data.
SETTING: Injured patients who were hospitalized in various trauma centers across the continental United States.
PATIENTS: Three age groups were identified for analysis as follows: 18 to 35 years, 36 to 64 years, and 65 years and older. One hundred one multiple logistic regression analyses were performed for each population. Hypotension was sequentially defined as an emergency department systolic BP (SBP) of 50 to 150 mm Hg to see which model best predicted mortality, adjusting for demographic and injury covariates. The discriminatory power of each model was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Optimally defined hypotension was identified as the model with the highest AUROC curve.
MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURE: In-hospital mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 902,852 patients (median age, 44 years; 66.2\% men) were analyzed. Overall mortality was 4.1\%. Optimal emergency department SBP cutoff values for hypotension were 85 mm Hg for patients aged 18 to 35 years, 96 mm Hg for patients aged 36 to 64 years, and 117 mm Hg for elderly patients.
CONCLUSIONS: For patients younger than 65 years, the classic definition of hypotension as an emergency department SBP less than 90 mm Hg remains optimal. With increasing involvement of elderly individuals in trauma and their peculiarity as a comorbid state, there is a need to redefine what is presently defined as a cutoff value for hypotension in elderly patients.},

Our objective was to determine if patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg have a worse outcome than patients with a higher SBP following trauma. Patients with gastric, small bowel, and/or diaphragm injuries were identified retrospectively through the trauma database from 1980-2003. All 2071 patients underwent emergent laparotomy at an urban, level one trauma center. The mortality rate of patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg in the ED or OR was 5\% (17/354) and significantly higher than the 1\% (12/1020) mortality seen in patients with a SBP of 110 mmHg or greater (P{\textless}0.001). The average length of stay of patients with a SBP of 90-109 mmHg was 15+/-14 days and was significantly longer than the 11+/-11 days seen in patients with a higher SBP. If the SBP was 90-109 mmHg, the infection rate was 39\% (131/340), and this was significantly higher than the 22\% (219/1016) infection rate seen in patients with higher SBP (P{\textless}0.001). Trauma patients with a systolic blood pressure of 109 mmHg or below are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality following trauma. Patients with a systolic blood pressure of 90-109 mmHg following trauma should be considered as a special group requiring aggressive resuscitation and surgery. Early operative control of hemorrhage in these patients can reduce mortality and infection.},

	abstract = {Studies of 4590 patients with blunt trauma injuries admitted to a Level I Trauma Center, have shown that 37\% had a blunt traumatic brain injury (BTBI). Of these brain injured patients 60\% has an associated other injury. Examination of mortality has shown that those with an isolated brain injury had an 11\% mortality compared with 21.8\% in those with an associated systemic injury. Further investigation demonstrated that the cause of the increased mortality was related to the blood loss associated with the injuries and that when hypovolemic shock resulted, mortality rose from 12.8 to 62\%. The severity of the associated injuries effect on the brain injured patient could be estimated by a parameter of oxygen debt, the base deficit and this allowed for a quantitative estimate of the probability of death as an index of severity. A combined linear logistic model using the admission Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) as a measure of brain injury and the base deficit as a measure of physiologic injury provides such a predictive score. The effect of associated injuries in patients with moderate brain injury (AIS 2,3) was to increase the average total cost of medical care in the first year of injury by three-fold (\$12,489 to \$36,177) and for severe brain injury (AIS 4,5) to increase average cost from \$59,000 in isolated BTBI to \$90,000 in BTBI with associated injury. The high incidence of brain injuries in motor vehicle crashes (MVC) caused by lateral impacts and their association with other side-impact injuries (lungs, spleen, kidney, and pelvic fractures) in which large blood volume losses are common, focuses attention on the need for side impact protection standards that simultaneously protect brain, thoracoabdominal viscera, and pelvis as a means of reducing the severity and cost of lateral impact MVCs.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A computer-based system to apply trauma resuscitation protocols to patients with penetrating thoracoabdominal trauma was previously validated for 97 consecutive patients at a Level 1 trauma center by a panel of the trauma attendings and further refined by a panel of national trauma experts. The purpose of this article is to describe how this system is now used to objectively critique the actual care given to those patients for process errors in reasoning, independent of outcome.
METHODS: A chronological narrative of the care of each patient was presented to the computer program. The actual care was compared with the validated computer protocols at each decision point and differences were classified by a predetermined scoring system from 0 to 100, based on the potential impact on outcome, as critical/noncritical/no errors of commission, omission, or procedure selection.
RESULTS: Errors in reasoning occurred in 100\% of the 97 cases studied, averaging 11.9/case. Errors of omission were more prevalent than errors of commission (2. 4 errors/case vs 1.2) and were of greater severity (19.4/error vs 5. 1). The largest number of errors involved the failure to record, and perhaps observe, beside information relevant to the reasoning process, an average of 7.4 missing items/patient. Only 2 of the 10 adverse outcomes were judged to be potentially related to errors of reasoning.
CONCLUSIONS: Process errors in reasoning were ubiquitous, occurring in every case, although they were infrequently judged to be potentially related to an adverse outcome. Errors of omission were assessed to be more severe. The most common error was failure to consider, or document, available relevant information in the selection of appropriate care.},

We undertook a review of trauma management errors at our institution with maximal impact (death). The analysis was based on the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) taxonomy.
METHODS: Trauma deaths between 2001 and 2006 at our Level I trauma were peer-reviewed to identify errors in management. The errors are classified according to type, domain, and cause.
RESULTS: Seventy-six (9.9\%) of 764 deaths had management errors contributing to potentially preventable deaths in 60 (errors in management might have contributed to death) and preventable deaths (management errors definitely contributed to death) in 16 patients. Questionable resuscitation was the commonest type and involved poor treatment in the majority. Errors were made in all domains but most commonly in the emergency department and the operating room and in the resuscitative phase. Human errors predominated.
CONCLUSIONS: Management errors in the basics of trauma care continue even in established trauma centers, despite guidelines, protocols, and continuous performance improvement. Standardized reporting such as the taxonomy may result in progressive collection of patient safety data and lead to innovations to minimize these errors.},

Twelve percent of the global disease burden is the result of violence or accidental injury. Hemorrhage is responsible for 30 to 40\% of trauma mortality, and of these deaths, 33 to 56\% occur during the prehospital period. Among those who reach care, early mortality is caused by continued hemorrhage, coagulopathy, and incomplete resuscitation. The techniques of early care, including blood transfusion, may underlie late mortality and long-term morbidity. While the volume of blood lost cannot be measured, physiologic and chemical measures and the number of units of blood given are readily recorded and analyzed. Improvements in early hemorrhage control and resuscitation and the prevention and aggressive treatment of coagulopathy appear to have the greatest potential to improve outcomes in severely injured trauma patients.},

	abstract = {Before assessment can begin we must decide how quality is to be defined and that depends on whether one assesses only the performance of practitioners or also the contributions of patients and of the health care system; on how broadly health and responsibility for health are defined; on whether the maximally effective or optimally effective care is sought; and on whether individual or social preferences define the optimum. We also need detailed information about the causal linkages among the structural attributes of the settings in which care occurs, the processes of care, and the outcomes of care. Specifying the components or outcomes of care to be sampled, formulating the appropriate criteria and standards, and obtaining the necessary information are the steps that follow. Though we know much about assessing quality, much remains to be known.(JAMA 1988;260:1743-1748)},

METHODS: Admission physiology, injury and outcome variables from adult injured patients presenting to hospitals in England and Wales between 1989 and 2007 and stored on the Trauma Audit and Research Network (TARN) database, were studied. For each patient, the blood loss was estimated and patients were divided into four groups based on the estimated blood loss corresponding to the ATLS classes of shock. The median and interquartile ranges (IQR) of the heart rate (HR) systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate (RR) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were calculated for each group.
RESULTS: The median HR rose from 82 beats per minute (BPM) in estimated class 1 shock to 95 BPM in estimated class 4 shock. The median SBP fell from 135 mm Hg to 120 mm Hg. There was no significant change in RR or GCS.
CONCLUSION: With increasing estimated blood loss there is a trend to increasing heart rate and a reduction in SBP but not to the degree suggested by the ATLS classification of shock.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Determination of the need for massive transfusion (MT) is essential for early activation of a MT protocol. The Traumatic Bleeding Severity Score (TBSS) predicts the need for MT accurately, but takes time to determine because systolic blood pressure after a 1000mL of crystalloid infusion is used. The aim of this study is to determine the how well the Modified TBSS (age, sonography, pelvic fracture, serum lactate and systolic blood pressure on arrival) predicts the need for MT (accuracy).
METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study of trauma patients (Injury Severity Score ≧16) admitted between 2010 and 2014. The TBSS, the Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage (TASH) Score, and the Modified TBSS were calculated. MT is defined as ≧10 U packed red blood cell transfusion within 24hours of injury, and the predictive value of the need for MT was compared by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis among three scores.
RESULTS: Three hundred patients were enrolled, and MT given to 25\% of patients. Although the AUC of the TBSS was higher than that of the TASH score (0.956 vs 0.912, P=.006) and the Modified TBSS (0.956 vs 0.915, P=.001), there was no difference between the AUC of the Modified TBSS and the TASH score. The Modified TBSS has high accuracy, within an AUC {\textgreater}0.9.
CONCLUSION: The predictive value of the Modified TBSS of the need for MT is still high and is equivalent to the TASH score. The Modified TBSS is calculated earlier in resuscitation than the original TBSS.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: To develop a simple scoring system that allows an early and reliable estimation for the probability of mass transfusion (MT) as a surrogate for life threatening hemorrhage following multiple trauma.
METHODS: Potential clinical and laboratory variables documented in the Trauma Registry of the German Trauma Society (DGU) (1993-2003; n=17,200) were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to predict the probability for MT.
RESULTS: Clinical and laboratory variables available from data sets were screened for their association with mass transfusion. MT was defined by transfusion requirement of {\textgreater}or=10 units of packed red blood cells from emergency room (ER) to intensive care unit admission. Seven independent variables were identified to be significantly correlated with an increased probability for MT: systolic blood pressure ({\textless}100 mm Hg=4 pts, {\textless}120 mm Hg=1 pt), hemoglobin ({\textless}7 g/dL=8 pts, {\textless}9 g/dL=6 pts, {\textless}10 g/dL=4 pts, {\textless}11 g/dL=3 pts, and {\textless}12 g/dL=2 pts), intra-abdominal fluid (3 pts), complex long bone and/or pelvic fractures (AIS 3/4=3 pts and AIS 5=6 pts), heart rate ({\textgreater}120=2 pts), base excess ({\textless}-10 mmol/L=4 pts, {\textless}-6 mmol/L=3 pts, and {\textless}-2 mmol/L=1 pt), and gender (male=1 pt). These variables were incorporated into a risk score, the Trauma Associated Severe Hemorrhage Score (TASH-Score, 0-28 points). Performance of the score was tested with respect to discrimination, precision, and calibration. Increasing TASH-Score points were associated with an increasing probability for MT.
CONCLUSION: The TASH-Score is an easy-to-use scoring system that reliably predicts the probability for MT after multiple trauma. Taken as a surrogate for life threatening bleeding calculation may focus attention on relevant variables indicative for risk and impact strategies to stop bleeding and stabilize coagulation in acute trauma care.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Assessment of Blood Consumption (ABC) score is a previously validated scoring system designed to predict which severely injured trauma patients will require massive transfusion. When the ABC score is used in the prehospital setting to activate massive transfusion at the receiving hospital, a 23\% decrease in mortality has been demonstrated. However, the ABC score was developed and validated using hospital data from the emergency department (ED). The sensitivity and specificity of the ABC score when calculated using data from the prehospital setting are unknown. We hypothesized that the sensitivity and specificity of the prehospital ABC score will be similar to the sensitivity and specificity of the ED ABC score.
METHODS: A 5-year retrospective analysis (2015-2019) of highest-activation adult trauma patients arriving to a quaternary Level I trauma center by hospital-based helicopter air medical service (HEMS) was performed. Demographic, prehospital, ED triage, and blood product utilization data were collected. Prehospital ABC score was calculated using the highest heart rate, lowest systolic blood pressure, and focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) exam results obtained prior to arrival at the trauma center. ED ABC score was calculated using ED triage vital signs and ED FAST results. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve were calculated for each ABC score.
RESULTS: 2,067 patients met inclusion criteria. Mean age 39 (±17) years, 76\% male, 22\% penetrating mechanism. Of these, 128 patients (6\%) received massive transfusion using the definition from the original study. Prehospital ABC score at a cutoff of 2 was 51\% sensitive and 85\% specific for predicting massive transfusion, with 83\% correctly classified and an AUROC = 0.73. ED ABC score at the same cutoff was 60\% sensitive and 84\% specific, with 83\% correctly classified and an AUROC = 0.81. By logistic regression, the odds of massive transfusion increased by 2.76 for every 1-point increase in prehospital ABC score (95\%CI 2.25-3.37, p {\textless} 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ABC score is a useful prehospital tool for identifying who will require massive transfusion. Future studies to evaluate the effect of the prehospital ABC score on clinical care and mortality are necessary.},

	abstract = {Introduction: An assessment of physiological status is a key step in the early assessment of trauma patients with implications for triage, investigation and management. This has traditionally been done using vital signs. Previous work from large European trauma datasets has suggested that base deficit (BD) predicts clinically important outcomes better than vital signs (VS). A BD derived classification of haemorrhagic shock appeared superior to one based on VS derived from ATLS criteria in a population of predominantly blunt trauma patients. The initial aim of this study was to see if this observation would be reproduced in penetrating trauma patients. The power of each individual variable (BD, heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), shock index(SI) (HR/SBP) and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS)) to predict mortality was then also compared. Methods: A retrospective analysis of adult trauma patients presenting to the Pietermaritzburg Metropolitan Trauma Service was performed. Patients were classified into four “shock” groups using VS or BD and the outcomes compared. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were then generated to compare the predictive power for mortality of each individual variable. Results: 1863 patients were identified. The overall mortality rate was 2.1\%. When classified by BD, HR rose and SBP fell as the “shock class” increased but not to the degree suggested by the ATLS classification. The BD classification of haemorrhagic shock appeared to predict mortality better than that based on the ATLS criteria. Mortality increased from 0.2\% (Class 1) to 19.7\% (Class 4) based on the 4 level BD classification. Mortality increased from 0.3\% (Class 1) to 12.6\% (Class 4) when classified based by VS. Area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROC) curve analysis of the individual variables demonstrated that BD predicted mortality significantly better than HR, GCS, SBP and SI. AUROC curve (95\% Confidence Interval (CI)) for BD was 0.90 (0.85-0.95) compared to HR 0.67(0.56-0.77), GCS 0.70(0.62-0.79), SBP 0.75(0.65-0.85) and SI 0.77(0.68–0.86). Conclusion: BD appears superior to vital signs in the immediate physiological assessment of penetrating trauma patients. The use of BD to assess physiological status may help refine their early triage, investigation and management.},
