# Opportunities for improvement in the care of adult trauma patients arriving in shock

This repository includes the manuscript and code for the research project on opportunities for improvement in the care of adult trauma patients arriving in shock. 

## Summary

### Introduction
Trauma - physical injury and the bodyâ€™s associated response - is a major cause of death and
disability worldwide. Every year, over four million people die from trauma, and it is the top cause
of burden of disease in young people. Trauma quality improvement programmes aim to identify
opportunities for improvement in the care of trauma patients, and to implement changes to
improve patient outcomes. The initial management of trauma patients once they reach hospital is
very time sensitive and error prone, especially in patients arriving in shock. Little is known
however about the specific types of opportunities for improvement that are present in the care of
these patients.

### Aim
This study aims to describe opportunities for improvement adult trauma patients arriving in
shock, and to assess how the degree of shock is associated with opportunities for improvement.

### Methods
This is a registry based cohort study using data from the trauma registry and trauma care quality
database at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna. The trauma registry includes about
14000 patients treated between 2012 and 2023. The trauma care quality database is a subset of the
trauma registry and includes about 8000 patients selected for review between 2014 and 2023. The
outcome is opportunities for improvement, such as delayed management or technical errors, as
identified by a multidisciplinary trauma quality improvement review board and recorded in the
trauma care quality database. This project will link the two databases and assess what types of
OFI occurred in patients arriving in shock and use adjusted logistic regression to assess the
association between the degree of shock and odds of opportunities for improvement. A 5%
significance level and 95% confidence levels will be used.
